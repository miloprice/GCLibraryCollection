LibraryCollection
=================

A public web interface for patrons to view and search a library collection.

Ruby 2.3.5

###After you pull from origin, run:
 - bundle install --without production
 - rake db:migrate
 - rake db:seed RAILS_ENV=development
 - rails server

 Note: We now have different seed files for the different environments, so that we're not seeding a ton of fake books on production, only what we need. Therefore, we must now specify the environment when running 'rake db:seed'
